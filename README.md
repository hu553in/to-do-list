## Description

## Tech stack

* Java 17
* Spring Boot
* PostgreSQL

## How to configure

You can perform a base app configuration using the following [.env file](./.env).

Also, you can change the default user set in the following
[Flyway migration](./src/main/resources/db/migration/repeatable/R__create_users.sql).\
Note that the `password` column of the `app_user` table stores password hashes generated using
[Bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) (10 rounds).\
[Here](https://www.browserling.com/tools/bcrypt) you can generate hashes for your custom user set.

**Note:** be careful when changing default configuration values.\
Remember that you will need to use your custom values instead of used in instructions below.

## How to run

1. Install Docker, Docker Compose, OpenJDK (â‰¥ 17), GNU Make
2. Run following commands to get the ability to use Docker as non-root user:

    ```
    groupadd docker
    usermod -aG docker $(id -un)
    systemctl enable docker
    ```

3. Reboot your machine to apply changes performed in the previous step
4. Run `make`

When the server is started, you can open [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) to see API docs.
